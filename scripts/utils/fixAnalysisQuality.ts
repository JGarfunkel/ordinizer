    // Create focused prompt that addresses specific quality issues
    const prompt = `You are analyzing tree regulations for ${municipalityName}. 

CRITICAL QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
1. Answer ONLY the specific question asked - do not include information that belongs to other questions
2. Search the ENTIRE statute text thoroughly - information may appear in multiple sections
3. Use consistent environmental protection scoring across all municipalities
4. If you find relevant information, provide a complete answer - don't say "not specified" when information exists

SPECIFIC QUESTION TO ANSWER: ${question.question}

OTHER QUESTIONS (for context - do NOT answer these):
${allQuestions.filter(q => q.id !== question.id).map(q => `${q.id}. ${q.question}`).join('\n')}

FULL STATUTE TEXT TO SEARCH:
${statuteText}

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION SCORING RUBRIC (be consistent across municipalities):
- 1.0 = Comprehensive protection: Detailed requirements, strong enforcement, clear penalties >$1000, mandatory replacement, professional oversight
- 0.8 = Strong protection: Good requirements with enforcement, penalties $500-1000, replacement rules  
- 0.6 = Moderate protection: Basic permit requirements, penalties $250-500, some replacement rules
- 0.4 = Weak protection: Minimal requirements, low penalties <$250, unclear enforcement
- 0.2 = Very weak protection: Vague requirements, minimal penalties, poor enforcement
- 0.0 = No protection: No requirements found or completely inadequate

GAP ANALYSIS REQUIREMENT:
If your score is less than 1.0, you MUST provide a "gap" field explaining specifically what would be needed to achieve a perfect 1.0 environmental protection score. Focus on concrete improvements like:
- Higher penalty amounts
- Mandatory professional consultation (arborist, environmental review)  
- Stricter replacement ratios
- Clearer enforcement mechanisms
- More comprehensive permit requirements
- Better notification processes
- Data collection requirements

FOCUS EXAMPLES:
- If asked about permits: Focus ONLY on permit process, requirements, who reviews - do NOT mention neighbor notification
- If asked about notifications: Focus ONLY on who to notify and when - do NOT mention permit processes  
- If asked about penalties: Focus ONLY on fines and consequences - do NOT mention replacement requirements
- If asked about replacement: Focus ONLY on replanting rules and species - do NOT mention permit processes
